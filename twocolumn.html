	<div class="left-column"><p></p>l have a friend, Deborah,
a psychologist...
...who was asked
by the city of Philadelphia...
if she could offer psychological
counseling to Cambodian refugees...
...boat people,
who had recently arrived in the city.
Deborah was daunted by the task.
These Cambodians...
had suffered genocide, starvation,
relatives murdered before their eyes...
...years in refugee camps,
harrowing boat trips to the West.
How could she relate
to their suffering?
How could she help these people?
So guess what all these people
wanted to talk about...
...with my friend Deborah,
the psychologist.
lt was all,
"l met this guy in the refugee camp.
I thought he really loved me,
but when we got separated...
...he took up with my cousin.
Now he says he loves me...
...and keeps calling me. They're
married now. What should l do?"
This is how we are.
May I help you?
I'm Liz Gilbert. I'm writing
a magazine article on Bali.
I wanted to meet a medicine man.
Everyone said I should meet
Ketut Liyer. Am l in the right place?
Wait.
l mean, here I am with
a ninth-generation medicine man...
...and what do I wanna
ask him about?
Getting closer to God?
Saving the world's
starving children?
Happy to see you. l am Ketut Liyer.
Nope. l wanna discuss
my relationship.
You are a world traveler.
You will live a long time...
...have many friends,
many experiences.
You will have two marriages.
One long, one short.
Am l in the long one
or the short one?
Can't tell.Also you will lose all your money.
I think in next six to 1 0 months.
Don't worry.
You will get it all back again.
And you will come back to Bali...
...and live here for three or four
months and teach me English.
I never had anybody
to practice my English with.
And then...
l will teach you everything l know.
Wait.
I have this for you.
Keep grounded so it's like
you have four legs.
That way, you can stay in this world.
Also, no looking at world
through your head.
Look through your heart instead.
That way, you will know God.
Which is why you came here, no?
See you later, alligator.
I proofread all of her manuscripts.
My wife is very, very beautiful,
but she can't spell for anything.
Look at Uncle Stephen.
And Auntie Liz.
I'm counting the minutes for this to be
over so l can get in my big girl pants.
You look fantastic.
You just had a baby.
Oh, you're lying.
I'm fat, I'm exhausted...
...l can't keep two thoughts.
I feel like Liza Minnelli.
Stephen, can you hold Jack?
-l'm gonna introduce you to Walter.
-Yeah.
Hey, dude, you wanna grab a beer
or something?
My new book comes out in April.
Thank you for asking.
-Great.
-May.
May. May.A frigging loom.
And he tried to start a microbrewery.
I don't know how you guys
aren't sick of me now. I'm sick of me.
Are you kidding me?
We love having you.
It's kind of like having
a writer in residence.
But you are a writer.
You should be writing something.
Maybe I could write about a woman
who goes to Italy to learn ltalian.
Call it
Carbohydrates and Conjugations.
I'll start looking for a place.
-l'm falling in love with you.
-l'm not who you think I am.
I'm just your fantasy.
No, that's bullshit. You're real.
Your scars, your talent.
The fact that
I own a piece-of-crap bar...
...and you accept that
that's all l'm gonna do.
Okay, this sucks.
-l second that.
-Don't be rude.
I love your pain.
And l love that when we're together,
I can make it go away.
-Oh, he's good.
-You're love...
-He's hot, there's a difference.
-...is like a hot panini.
And when I look into your eyes,
I hear dolphins clapping.
I did not write that line.
Here's what he doesn't know yet.
I disappear into the person l love.
I am the permeable membrane.
If l love you, you can have it all.
My money, my time, my body...
...my dog, my dog's money.
I will assume your debts
and project upon you...
...all sorts of nifty qualities you've
never actually cultivated in yourself.
I will give you all this and more...
...until l am so exhausted
and depleted...
...the only way l can recover...
...is by becoming infatuated
with someone else.
-Elizabeth, hi.
-Hi.
Oh, really?
How you doing?<p></div>

    <div class="right-column"><p></p>This is Andre. You two are
Times' Most Notable nominees.
-So glad to finally meet you.
-Nice to finally meet you.
I fed him nachos. ls that bad?
You look comfortable.
What'd you feed him, chloroform?
-Give him to his dad.
-l told you, nachos.
Know what? I'd be asleep too
if l had a dump like that.
-We'll give him to his mom.
-Come here then.
-Wanna help me change his diaper?
-Yes, I do.
Hey, how's the vintage car
thing going?
Oh, no, no, no. l changed jobs.
I'm a pastry chef now.
-You mean you're a baker.
-Yeah.
You wanna get baked?
I know, I know.
It's hard, isn't it?
Oh, no. This is so much fun.
Did you know the exact moment
you wanted to have a baby?
I can't remember, but l've had the box
since before l got married.
What box?
It's girly and embarrassing,
and you'll laugh at me if I tell you.
I will laugh at you,
but you still have to tell me.
Come on.
Under the bed.
I've been filling it with baby things...
...waiting until Andy
was ready to be a father.
So sweet.
Does this come in my size?
I have a box just like this, except
it's filled with National Geographics...
...and The Times travel section.
All the places l wanna see
before l die.
Liz, having a baby is like
getting a tattoo on your face.
You kind of wanna be
fully committed.
So my trip to Aruba next week,
which is just a basic, you know...
..."where to sleep, swim
and stuff your face" piece....
I got a new bikini.
And it turns out,
I have unlimited minibar access.
-You know what that means?
-Jet lag?
You, me...
...macadamia nuts.
That was cute.
You know who l was talking to
at the party who was really inspiring...
-...was Tara's friend.
-Brian.
Brian. Unbelievable.
He's a teacher, you know that?
He's a substitute teacher, isn't he?
Yeah. He was talking about the
budget cuts that are happening now.
There's no money for anything.
There's no music classes,
there's no arts classes.
They're volunteering their time
to do all of this after school.
They're educating our kids,
you know?
I think you'd make
a great teacher, honey.
Thank you,
but I was thinking more of like...
...education. Getting my masters,
going back to school. l don't know.
You know?
I-- You know....
-Going back to school.
-l'm just thinking out loud.
I was getting the sinking feeling that
Ketut's prophecy was coming true.
Was l in the shorter marriage?
We'd only bought this house
a year ago.
Hadn't I wanted this?
I had actively participated
in every moment of the creation...
...of this life.
So why didn't I see myself
in any of it?
The only thing more impossible
than staying...
...was leaving.
I didn't wanna hurt anybody. l wanted
to slip quietly out the back door...
...and not stop running
until l reached Greenland.
lnstead, l made a decision.
To pray.
You know, like, to God.
And it was such a foreign concept to
me, that l swear l almost began with:
"l'm a big fan of your work."
Hello, God?
Nice to finally meet you. l....
I am sorry l've never spoken
directly to you before...
...but...
...l hope l've expressed my...
...ample gratitude for all
the blessings you've given...
...to me in my life.
I'm in serious trouble.
I don't know what to do.
I need an answer.
Please, tell me what to do.
Oh, God, help me, please.
Tell me what to do and l'll do it.
Go back to bed, Liz.
I don't wanna go to Aruba.
I don't wanna be married.
You know, there's a whole
divorce section downstairs.
-"Pepper grinder."
-She's having...
-...a nervous breakdown.
-This is what girls do.
-She's processing.
-Why doesn't she get drunk or laid?
That's what l would do if you left me.
No, you wouldn't.
-No, I wouldn't.
-She moved out, she filed for divorce.
They were together eight years.
She's got no home.
"Legacy."
Every word in Italian is like a truffle.
A magic trick.
Honey, l get it.
It's your life raft right now.
When Andy and l broke up
for two weeks, l bought a loom.<p></div>
